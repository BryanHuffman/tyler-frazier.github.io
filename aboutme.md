Welcome! My name is Tyler Frazier and I am a Lecturer of Data Science at William & Mary.  My research and teaching focus on the use of data science methods to describe, analyze, model and predict human development patterns and processes.  Prior to joining William & Mary in the spring of 2015, I held academic appointments at the University of Bonn - Center for Development Research, the Santa Fe Institute, and the Technical University of Berlin - Institute for Transport System Planning and Transport Telematics. I also previously served as a visiting lecturer at the Technical University of Munich, the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology and the University of Ghana, Legon.  My research has been supported by funding from the Volkswagen Foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research.

I received my Ph.D. in Geography from the University of Bonn, Germany in 2011, a Masters in City and Regional Planning from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2001, and a Bachelor of Arts in Architectural History from the Savannah College of Art and Design in 1999.  Since 2006 my research and teaching has focused on the use of ** statistical ** programming to advance data use for understanding human and community scale processes. My primary programming language of choice since 2010 has been R with the sp and sf (Pebesma & Bivand), raster (Hijmans), spatstat (Baddeley) and tidyverse (Wickham) packages, among many others.  While I started using python in 2007, more recently I have turned my attention to its ** computational ** advantages, particularly as it relates to tensorflow, pytorch and a number of other machine / deep learning, probability and computer vision methods.

<br>  

Between 2001 and 2006, I authored numerous land use and development applications at the state, regional and county levels in both Georgia and Florida, and obtained certification as a member of the American Institute of Certified Planners (AICP).  I am also fluent in German, conversant in Portuguese, and informally conversant with Twi (Ghana), French and Spanish.  From 2007 until 2012, I held a permanent residence in Ghana, staying there for several extended periods while conducting field research and project related work.  While the scope of my teaching as a data scientist focuses on human development from a broader perspective, my primary research interest is on the **human development** of _West Africa_ with emphasis on the _Repubic of Ghana_.
