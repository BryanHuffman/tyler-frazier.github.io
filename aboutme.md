Welcome! My name is Tyler Frazier and I am a Lecturer of Data Science at William & Mary, where I generally conduct research in the area of population and development data science.  Prior to joining William & Mary in the spring of 2015, I held academic appointments at the University of Bonn - Center for Development Research, the Santa Fe Institute, and the Technical University of Berlin - Institute for Transport System Planning and Transport Telematics. I also previously served as a visiting lecturer at the Technical University of Munich, the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology and the University of Ghana, Legon.  Individually, my research has been supported by funding from the Volkswagen Foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research.

I received my Ph.D. in Natural Sciences from the faculty of Geography at the University of Bonn, Germany in 2011, a Masters of Science in City Planning from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2001, and a Bachelor of Arts with a major in Architectural History from the Savannah College of Art and Design in 1999.  Since 2006 my research and teaching have focused on data use in statistical programming to describe, analyze, model and predict human and community scale, development patterns and processes. Since 2010, my primary programming language has been R with the sp/sf (Pebesma & Bivand), raster (Hijmans), spatstat (Baddeley) and ggplot/tidyverse (Wickham) packages, among many others.  More recently I have returned to the computational advantages presented by python and the tensorflow and pytorch libraries of functions.

From 2001 and 2006, I worked as a land use planner mostly on projects located in the southeastern United States, and in 2004 obtained certification as a member of the American Institute of Certified Planners (AICP).  I am fluent in German, conversant in Portuguese, and informally conversant with Twi (Ghana), French and Spanish.  From 2007 until 2012, I held a permanent residence in Ghana, staying there for several extended periods while conducting field research and project related work.  While the scope of my teaching broadly focuses on population and development data science, my primary research focus is in the human development of West Africa with emphasis on the Repubic of Ghana.
